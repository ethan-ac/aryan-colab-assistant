# START OF CODE

# Virtual Assistant.py Â©

# This is the code for a simple chatbot/virtual assistant. It is currently capable of:
# 1. Responding to courtesies.
# 2. Displaying the date and time.
# 3. Performing searches on wikipedia

# CURRENT PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED:
# 1. Right now, everytime the user says somethings to the computer, it responds and then the code stops.
# We need to find a way for it to correctly loop through.

# THINGS TO ADD:
# 1. Ability to send texts
# 2. Ability to dial a number
# 3. Ability to set a timer/alarm.

# For ETHAN: feel free to go through the code, let me know if you don't understand something.
# You might have to go through the installation steps for some of the classes I have used.
# You can look it up online on geeksforgeeks or stack overflow.
