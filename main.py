# Virtual Assistant.py Â©

# This is the code for a simple chatbot/virtual assistant. It is currently capable of:
# 1. Responding to courtesies.
# 2. Displaying the date and time.
# 3. Performing searches on wikipedia

#TODO
# 1. searching "donkey" returns "honey" from wikipedia, is there a way to double check/stop this error
# 2. when searching for an invalid/ambiguous term ie "slot"
# 3. automatically determine if text or speech input is to be taken


# THINGS TO ADD:
# 1. Ability to send texts
# 2. Ability to dial a number
# 3. Ability to set a timer/alarm
